    "Brief history of your project and organization": "https://registry.opendata.aws/kyfromabove/\n\nThe KyFromAbove initiative is focused on building and maintaining a current basemap for Kentucky that can meet the needs of its users at the state, federal, local, and regional level. A common basemap, including current color leaf-off aerial photography and elevation data (LiDAR), reduces the cost of developing GIS applications, promotes data sharing, and add efficiencies to many business processes. All basemap data acquired through this effort is being made available in the public domain. KyFromAbove acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions in the Commonwealth. The imagery typically ranges from 6-inches to 3-inches in resolution and is available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket in a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff format. LiDAR data acquired by the program is USGS Quality Level 2 (QL2). Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at a 2-foot resolution, point cloud data in an LAS format, spot elevations in a geopackage format, and contours in a geopackage format are also available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket. KyFromAbove LiDAR and imagery data resources are managed in a Kentucky-specific 5000x5000 foot grid (FIPS:1600) (EPSG:3089). More details about the program can be found at (https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/)",
